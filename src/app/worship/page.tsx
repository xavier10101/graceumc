                A nursery is provided with a nursery worker and volunteers during both worship services and Sunday School. As part of the United Methodist Church, we practice &ldquo;Safe Sanctuaries&rdquo; to protect all children from any form of abuse. Parents are always welcome to visit the nursery.

              <p className="mt-2">
                Children are always welcome in worship! Coloring and activity pages related to the day&apos;s theme are available at the back of the sanctuary.

              We celebrate Holy Communion on the first Sunday of each month. We practice an &ldquo;open table&rdquo; — all are invited to partake as you feel comfortable. Membership is not required. We serve grape juice. Receive the bread and cup as signs of God&apos;s love and forgiveness.
